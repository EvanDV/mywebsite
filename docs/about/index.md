# Introduction
My name is Evan Davies-Velie, I am a radio astronomer focussed on both data analysis and instrumentation. 

I completed my B.Sc. in Joint Honours Physics and Computer Science at McGill University. During my undergraduate studies I had the opportunity to work with data from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). You can find more about my projects involing CHIME [here](../reasearch/index.md).

I have also contributed to the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) by analyzing system temperatures of the Deep Dish Development Array (D3A). To analyze data from this prototype telescope, I had to work with extremely low level data. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of radio telescope instrumentation and data handling, which is crucial for both future instrumentation projects and data analysis.

These experiences have solidified my commitment to advancing research in radio astronomy, particularly in the context of cutting-edge Canadian instruments like CHIME and CHORD. I am excited to continue my journey in this field, contributing to the development and science operations of these pioneering telescopes.

Through my TAing experiences during my undergraduate and as a graduate student I have found a passion for teaching. I would like to go on to earn my PhD and eventually become a professor. As a graduate student, I am looking forward to further developing my teaching and communication skills.

Beyond physics I am very interested in music. I love searching for niche songs and undiscovered artists. I compile these in playlists that you can view on my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/4p840o2nt3xrolnxyo79oh7eb?si=1668305cd5f54542). I plan to volunteer at the CKUT and hopefully get my own show eventually!
